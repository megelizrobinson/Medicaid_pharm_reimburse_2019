# Medicaid_pharm_reimburse_2019

# The aim of this project was to create a visualization of Medicaid pharmacy reimbursement costs throughout the US in 2019 using RStudio. 
# The dataset containing information on reimbursement costs by state and payment method was retrieved from Medicaidâ€™s open data site (Data.Medicaid.gov). However,
# this dataset was not uploaded to github due to the file being too large.
# The cleaned and transformed data was plotted using the ggplot2 package and revealed pharmacy reimbursement totals by state, region, and payment model.
